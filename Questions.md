1. What is still broken (or not quite perfect) about your program? Why?

The only thing that is not quite perfect within my code is the double down action. The action does double the bet placed on a player's hand, but does not automatically add another card to the hand. Also, the bet option works for the most part, but only fails to work when the "bet" button is clicked five or more times consecutively.

2. What is the best single feature of your program? What sets it apart from other students' work?

The best single feature of my program would have to be the layout. I wanted to make the layout easy to read and the fact that it displays each card and tells you both your balance and how much you bet at the end of the game distinguishes it from other students' work.

3. How are classes in Java used to create a complicated program?

If the entire program was created using one class, not only would the code be excessive, but it would also be difficult to understand. If someone were to read the code and try to understand what it means, the classes make it much easier to follow. Also, separating specific parts of the program allows the programmer to locate exactly where within the code each action is occurring.

4. What is the difference between a private and public variable? Method?

Private variables can only be accessed within a specific class and public variables can be accessed from any class. Private methods are like private variables, in the sense that they can only be referenced inside their own class. This is the reason that in the Blackjack code, my methods were all public, although my variables were private.

5. What is the difference between a class and an instance?

Class variables become available as the code is executed. This means that you can access them without using objects. Instance variables are declared in a class and are accessed using the objects you create in the class.

6. What is inheritance and why is it beneficial?

Inheritance is when several different classes utilize similar states and behaviors. This is useful, because rather than repeating several methods repeatedly throughout the code, you can simply inherit the states and behaviors from other classes.

7. What is the purpose of the keyword this? What about super?

The keyword "this" implies that you are referencing the current object instance. This is beneficial in a class where you are dealing with multiple objects. The "super" function calls the default constructor of a class, meaning that it does not require parameters all the time.

8. What are the two properties of all objects?

The two properties of all objects are the state of the object and the behavior of the object.

9. What is something about Object Oriented Design that still confuses you? The thing that still confuses me about Object Oriented Design is probably when you use the same method name for two methods in a class, but use different parameters for each method. I understand how the program interprets this, but I don't understand how this is useful, as opposed to simply giving the two methods different names.
